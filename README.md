# KufarStatsApp
A simple app that handles some Kufar queries and prints out statistics.
There is room for improvements. Stuff I would also add:
- Exceptions and exception handling. Proper implementation would take more time.
- More unit tests. Obviously.
- Improve project structure. Add config files to store stuff like urls.
- Better documentation for classes and methods. Although I think it's fine as is.
- Polish output to look prettier. It's messy at the moment, but there where no strict requirements for that so...
